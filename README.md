# Automatic Detection of Ventricular Fibrillation through Electrocardiogram

Please be aware that numerous variations and experiments were conducted during this study. However, only the automatic method that yielded the most favorable outcome has been included in this summary of the work. To access the entire study, please read the full [report](Projeto_RuÃÅben_93203.pdf) (portuguese).

## Motivation

According to the National Health Service (SNS), heart diseases continue to be the leading cause of death in Portugal, accounting for more than 35 thousand annual deaths in our country. These numbers reflect about one-third of the total annual national mortalities, highlighting an extreme concern in this area. 
Nevertheless, the inevitability of these cardiac problems occurring compels society to seek new solutions to prevent further fatal cases. Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency condition where the heart rate is uncontrolled and extremely high. Therefore, this work is based on the construction of an algorithm capable of detecting ventricular fibrillation by exploiting ECG characteristics.
